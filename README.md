### Optimizing models for image and text dual search

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cmattamira/VisualSearch)  
[White Paper](https://cmattamira.github.io/files/Multimodal%20Search%20in%20eCommerce%20White%20Paper.pdf)

As part of the [Math-to-Industry Bootcamp](https://cse.umn.edu/ima/events/math-industry-boot-camp-viii) capstone internship project, my group ([Pavel Kovalev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pvl-kovalev/), [Jeremy Shahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-shahan/), [Meagan Kenney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meagan-kenney-544056266/), [Tanuj Gupta](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/tanujgupta), and [Hannah Solomon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-solomon-197464284/)) and I worked with [Christopher Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-miller-a0323a77/), an applied researcher at eBay, on building and optimizing models to improve eBay’s text and image dual search. We utilized semantic text and image embedding algorithms ([CLIP](https://openai.com/index/clip/), [BM25](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/index-similarity-and-scoring)), similarity search tools ([Faiss](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)), as well as traditional ML algorithms such as k-NN to optimize multimodal search results.

[5-minute Presentation](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/fall-2024/data-science-boot-camp/chiara-mattamira)

As part of the [Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) Fall 2024 Data Science Bootcamp group project, my group ([Shravan Patankar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shravan-patankar/), [Leyda Almodóvar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leyda-almod%C3%B3var-vel%C3%A1zquez-phd-66366335/), and [Neal Edgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neal-edgren-204011112/)) and I conducted a data-driven analysis to identify key diabetes risk factors in the U.S., highlighting the role of socioeconomic disparities. Our work combined data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning models (including linear regression, random forests, and XGBoost) to uncover population-level trends. See the attached executive summary and GitHub repo for more details, and check out our [five-minute presentation](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/fall-2024/data-science-boot-camp/chiara-mattamira), where we walk through our pipeline and key findings.

### Predicting antibiotic resistance from clinical and microbiological data *(In Progress)*

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Erdos-Projects/fall-2025-antibiotic-effectiveness)  
[Executive Summary](https://cmattamira.github.io/files/Executive_Summary_Antibiotics.pdf)  
[5-minute Presentation](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/fall-2025/data-science-boot-camp/chiara-mattamira/0b910526-e59e-413c-9f3c-0d99c2fa5ef2)

As part of the [Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) Fall 2025 Data Science Bootcamp group project, my group ([Dominique Hughes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominique-hughes-896099329/), [Tinghao Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinghao-huang-0ba743247/), [Haejun Oh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haejunoh/), and [Mustafain Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alimustafain/)) and I are working with a large publicly available dataset of clinical isolates and antibiotic susceptibility results ([Dryad Repository](https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.jq2bvq8kp)) to explore and predict patterns of antibiotic resistance.  
We aim to evaluate models that predict resistance either for individual antibiotics or at the patient level and to identify the features most predictive of resistance outcomes. Our goal is to generate actionable insights into antimicrobial resistance patterns while refining model interpretability and generalization.

### Developing efficient MCMC algorithms for single-molecule fluorescence data and step counting

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgouralis-research-group/step_finder)  
[Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349525005260)

This is an extensive research project I have done in collaboration with my co-advisor [Dr. Ioannis Sgouralis](https://math.utk.edu/labs/sgouralis/) as part of my doctoral research work. In this study, we introduce a novel statistical methodology for robust and efficient analysis of fluorescence data. Our innovative approach not only enhances the accuracy and reliability of data analysis following a fluorescence experiment but also enables high throughput applications. Our methods represent a significant advancement that may extend fluorescence techniques beyond high SNR and small data regimes.  
To broaden the applicability of our method, we built a user-friendly [app](https://github.com/sgouralis-research-group/step_finder) that can be used directly by experimentalists.

### Evaluating Monte Carlo methods for practical identifiability through the lens of stochasticity 

**(GitHub Repo coming soon)**  
[Pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26577)

This is another 2–3 year research project I have completed in collaboration with my co-advisor [Dr. Olivia Prosper Feldman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivia-prosper-feldman-19203332/?trk=public_post-text) as part of my doctoral research work. We evaluate standard Monte Carlo (MC) identifiability methods and show that their simplifying noise assumptions fail to capture the stochasticity and temporal dependence of epidemic models. Using the SIR model, we demonstrate that standard MC approaches underestimate uncertainty and propose a hybrid framework that better represents epidemic variability while remaining computationally efficient.

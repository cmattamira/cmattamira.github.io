### Evaluating key diabetes risk factors in the US

As part of the [Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) Data Science Bootcamp group project, my group (Leyda Almodóvar, Neal Edgren, Shravan Patankar, and I) conducted a data-driven analysis to identify key diabetes risk factors in the U.S., highlighting the role of socioeconomic disparities. See the attached executive summary and Github repo for more details.

### Optmizing models fro image&text dual search
As part of the [Math-to-Industry Bootcamp](https://cse.umn.edu/ima/events/math-industry-boot-camp-viii) capstone internship project, my group (Pavel Kovalev, Jeremy Shahan, Meagan Kenney, Tanuj Gupta, Hannah Solomon) and I worked with [Christopher Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-miller-a0323a77/), applied researcher at Ebay, on buildig and optimizing models to improve eBay’s text and image dual search. We utilized semantic text and image embedding algorithms ([CLIP](https://openai.com/index/clip/), [BM25](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/index-similarity-and-scoring)), similarity search tools ([Faiss](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)) as well as traditional ML algorithms such as k-NN to optimize multimodal search results.

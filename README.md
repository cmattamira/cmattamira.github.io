[Executive Summary](https://cmattamira.github.io/files/Executive_Summary_Diabetes.pdf)



As part of the [Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/) Data Science Bootcamp group project, my group ([Shravan Patankar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shravan-patankar/), [Leyda Almodóvar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leyda-almod%C3%B3var-vel%C3%A1zquez-phd-66366335/), [Neal Edgren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neal-edgren-204011112/), and I) conducted a data-driven analysis to identify key diabetes risk factors in the U.S., highlighting the role of socioeconomic disparities. See the attached executive summary and Github repo for more details.

[White Paper](https://github.com/cmattamira/cmattamira.github.io/blob/main/files/Multimodal%20Search%20in%20eCommerce%20White%20Paper.pdf)

As part of the [Math-to-Industry Bootcamp](https://cse.umn.edu/ima/events/math-industry-boot-camp-viii) capstone internship project, my group ([Pavel Kovalev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pvl-kovalev/), [Jeremy Shahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-shahan/), [Meagan Kenney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meagan-kenney-544056266/), [Tanuj Gupta](https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/tanujgupta), [Hannah Solomon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannah-solomon-197464284/)) and I worked with [Christopher Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-miller-a0323a77/), applied researcher at Ebay, on buildig and optimizing models to improve eBay’s text and image dual search. We utilized semantic text and image embedding algorithms ([CLIP](https://openai.com/index/clip/), [BM25](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/index-similarity-and-scoring)), similarity search tools ([Faiss](https://ai.meta.com/tools/faiss/), [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)) as well as traditional ML algorithms such as k-NN to optimize multimodal search results.

### Developing efficient MCMC algorithms for single-molecule fluorescence data and step counting

[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/sgouralis-research-group/step_finder)
[Publication]()

This is an extensive research project I have done in collaboration with my advisor [Dr. Ioannis Sgouralis](https://math.utk.edu/labs/sgouralis/) as part of my doctoral research work. In this study, we introduce a novel statistical methodology for robust and efficient analysis of fluorescence data. Our innovative approach not only enhances the accuracy and reliability of data analysis following a fluorescence experiment but also permits high throughput applications. Our methods represent a significant advancement that may extend fluorescence techniques beyond high SNR and small data regimes. 
To broaden the applicability of our method, we built a use friendly [app](https://github.com/sgouralis-research-group/step_finder) that can be used directly by experimentalists.
